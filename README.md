# Setting up a PC for Data Science

When preparing a PC for Data Science it is essential to install the right tools from the start. Here is my approach to it:

## Generic installation
* Install as private user windows
* Disable all options that send user data to microsoft
* Install the Brave webbrowser with the startpage as search engine - this browser provides more privacy
* Add fingerprint and pin options to log into windows (if you haven't done that already)

## R-tools
* Install Rstudio - https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop/
* Which means install R first: https://cran.rstudio.com/ (use base, extensions can be downloaded later on) - accept all defaults
* Install Rstudio

## Version control
* Install Git from here: https://git-scm.com/ - accept all default but change vim for notepad

## Python tools
* install miniconda, all recommended options checked, not added to PATH
* install pycharm from here: https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/ - community version - check all installation options

## Generic tools
* install Keepass 2: keepass.info - place to keep your passwords
* Install acrobat reader
* Install Wacom Intuos BT S, https://www.wacom.com/en-us/getting-started/wacom-intuos
* Install Norton - Virus scanner
* Install MS Office, https://helpdeskgeek.com/how-to/how-to-transfer-a-microsoft-office-license/
* Install MS office: https://turnkeypoint.com/how-to-download-and-install-office-2016-professional-plus/
* Install Whatsapp, from MS Store
* Install Signal, from https://signal.org/download/
* Select which apps to start at startup [Brave, Whatsapp, Signal], in Apps > Startup

## Make old hardware ready for someone else
